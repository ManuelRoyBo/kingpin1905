<h3>Stuff about me that might be useful one day: </h3>
I've been studying computer science (Web, mobile and video games) since August 2022. 
I used to be a robotic and science teacher (age 5-14) for some summer camps. 
I am an Esport producer.
I am a lighting and audio technician.
I would love to learn the basics of neural nets and deep learning in the future.

Well, you made it this far. Congrats! Have an amazing day!
